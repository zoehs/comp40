To compile the program simply type 'make' in the console with 40image
You can execute it with './40image'
Expects 2 commands after, either -c (for compress) or -d (decompress), and a 
file image (or can accept from stdin)

--- 
data_types.h       : holds all our structs needed to store different variable 
                     types for each 

40image.c          : module for reading in the command line and file, and 
                     determines if the image is going to be compressed or 
                     decompressed 

compress40.c       : module that calls our other functions to either compress 
                     or decompress the given image 

RGB_ints_floats.h  : interface of RGB_ints_floats.c

RGB_ints_floats.c  : module that converts all the RGB ints from the given 
                     image to RGB floats for compression, and vice versa 
                     for decompression

RGB_VCS.h          : interface of RGB_VCS.c

RGB_VCS.c          : module that uses all the RGB float variables to create 
                     a new UArray2 of VCS variables for compression and 
                     vice versa for decompression

VCS_DCT.h          : interface of VCS_DCT.c

VCS_DCT.c          : module that uses the VCS elements to make a new UArray2 
                     (1/4 the size) of DCT elements for compression, and 
                     vice versa for compression


bitpack.c          : module to perform bitpacking operations, including fit, 
                     get, and new on unsigned and signed integers for a 
                     64 bit codeword

codeword.h         : interface codeword.c

codeword.c         : module for packing and unpacking the 2x2 blocks from 
                     DCT elements (compression) or into DCT elements 
                     (decompression)

-- things that work correctly and don't ---

- we have tested compressing and decompressing with all images given in 
the comp40 folder (including the large folder) as well as a couple of others
found online ourselves. Ppm differences have come out to always be between
.008 to .04 (.04 was for a very large, very saturated image).
