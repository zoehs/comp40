unblackedges.c   : takes in an image and outputs the same image without
                   any black edges (including neighboring edges)

To compile the program simply type 'make' in the console with unblackedges
You can execute it with './unblackedges'
Expects 1 command line arg (name of image pbm file) or 0 command line args 
and will accept from stdin

--- 

sudoku.c         : takes in a sudoku grid and exits with whether or not
                   it is a solved sudoku grid

sudoku_helpers.h : interface for sudoku_helpers.c
sudoku_helpers.c : holds helper functions that sudoku.c needs

In order to compile the program simply type 'make' in the console with sudoku
You can execute it with './sudoku' 
Expects 1 command line arg (name of image pbm file) or 0 command line args 
and will accept from stdin

-- things that work correctly and don't ---

- from testing, it seems that all of our code works. We have done
  extensive testing on sudoku with different 9 x 9 grids, and for
  unblackedges, using the three tests written in lab, and the 
  images that were provided in the directory listed in the spec. Prior
  to all this, we conducted our own unit tests and incorporated 
  feedback from HW1, so as of now, we have no reason to believe
  there are any more bugs.
