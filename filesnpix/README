Brightness.c     : reads in an image and returns the brightness of the image

To compile the program simply type 'make' in the console with brightness
You can execute it with './brightness'
Expects 1 command line arg (name of image file) or 0 command line args and 
will accept from stdin

--- 

readaline.h      : (provided) interface for readaline.c
readaline.c      : reads a line that is passed in, and returns the size 
                   (bytes) of the line

In order to compile the program simply type 'make readaline.o' in the console
Just a function, not a main

simlines.c       : compares files that are passed in to the command line, and
                   prints out which lines are similar in each file with the 
                   corresponding line number

In order to compile the program simply type 'make' in the console
You can execute it with './simlines' and any file names to compare lines

utility.h        : interface for utility.c
utility.c        : holds general functions that are used in all three 
                   programs above 

string_funcs.h   : interface for string_funcs.c
string_funcs.c   : holds string functions that are used my simlines

Makefile         : standard Makefile needed to compile the program.
                   modified to also compile utility and string_funcs

-- things that work correctly and don't ---

- full credit version of readaline working
- known (acceptable*) still reachable memory leak from Atom
  *Piazza confirmed that this is allowed
- simlines can handle large numbers of matches and text
- no extra known bugs
