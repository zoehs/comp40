To compile the program simply type 'make' in the console with um
You can execute it with './um'
Expects a file after (ending with .um) and (optional) a file of inputs (.0) and
outputss through the unix pipeline

um.c                : module for reading in the command line and file, 

memory.h            : interface of memory.c

memory.c            : module that deals with our memory struct. Includes 
                      initializing and freeing 

load.h              : interface of load.c

load.c              : module that packs given file into codewords and stores
                      memory struct in order of given instructions 
                    

instructions.h      : interface of instructions.c

instructions.c      : module that contains all 14 - RISC style instructions 
                      needed to implement the UM. 
                      this module is use to execute um programs by reading and
                      decoding um_instructions and exeuting tasks.

                      The module makes use of bitpacking module provided by 
                      C40 admin.

-- Module Testing -- 

test_memory          : Test initialization of and freeing of memory data 
                       structure
                       Test name: init_free(); tested successfully

-- UM Unit Tests --
(all tests ends with outputting '\n' character (stdout to terminal is c
leaner), so all our .1 files ends with a new line character as well)

load_val.um       : tests the load value instructions (13) -- loads the 
                    letter 'C' into register 1, and outputs register 1, 
                    which should be 'C'

halt_test.um      : program is immediately exited (no outputs)

add_test.um       : 30 and 37 is loaded into the registers, should output 'C'

input.um          : takes input from stdin and prints it to stdout

nand_test.um      : loads '1' and '2' into registers, then calls NAND on the
                    two values and then calls it again on itself with the
                    result.
                    Should output 0

div_test.um       : loads 120 and 2 into registers, and should output '<'

mult_test.um      : loads 50 and 2 into registers, and should output 'd'

cond_move_test.um : loads 1 into register 3, and 'A' to register 2. Cmove is
                    called,and if it works, the value 'A' should be moved to
                    the register that is outputting the value. 

seg_load_store    : loads 'A' into a register, and stores that segment at (0,0)
                    then loads the segment into a register to ouput the same
                    value. 

map_test.um       : maps a segment, and if correct, the index that is outputted
                    should be '1'

unmap_test.um     : maps two new segments (each time printing its index value:
                    '1' and '2'), then unmaps the segment at index 1. Then a
                    new segment is mapped at that index, so the last output
                    value is '1' if successful.

load_prog.um      : creates a program with halt and loads it into our memory,
                    then runs
                    it.
                    If it fails, the program would not halt and instead print
                    'F' to output.

How long it will take to execute 50 million instructions: 
- using the command: time ./um midmark.um, our program ran in 7.501 sec.
We counted the number of instructions midmark contained by keeping track
of each instruction called.It contains 85070521 instructions, therefore 
for 50 million instructions it would takeroughly 4.409 seconds


-- things that work correctly and don't ---
All UM instructions are working:
- we have tested with multiple unit tests written ourselves as well as tests
  provided by the UM binaries zip file.

Time: The time taken for the um programs to run is inconsistent
      That may be indication that optimization of the um emulator is not
      best

Hours spend on completing assignment: 

    Approx. 5 hours spent on analyzing problems
    Approx. 6 hours spent on preparing the design
    Approx. 40 hours spent on solving the problems after our analysis
